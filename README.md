### üîç Logistic Regression Model
Welcome to the Logistic Regression Model project! This project was developed as part of a machine learning course to demonstrate the application of logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
- This project implements a logistic regression model to classify data into two or more distinct classes (using one vs. rest).
Includes a custom MessageToVector implementation that transforms messages into vectors using the Bag of Words concept and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
